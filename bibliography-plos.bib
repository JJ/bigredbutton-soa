In an effort to contribute to the increase in scholarship on the action film across the humanities, I will endeavor to explore in this chapter some of the most important and influential character types (the cop, the gangster, the cowboy, the swashbuckler), narrative tropes (foot and car chases, last-minute rescues, fight scenes), and visual techniques (camera movement to dynamize space, parallel editing to intensify time) as they emerged and evolved over the course of the first half-century of film propaedeutic to a comprehensive understanding of the action film.}

abstract = {Huge volumes of textual information has been produced every single day. In order to organize and understand such large datasets, in recent years, summarization techniques have become popular. These techniques aims at finding relevant, concise and non-redundant content from such a big data. While network methods have been adopted to model texts in some scenarios, a systematic evaluation of multilayer network models in the multi-document summarization task has been limited to a few studies. Here, we evaluate the performance of a multilayer-based method to select the most relevant sentences in the context of an extractive multi document summarization (MDS) task. In the adopted model, nodes represent sentences and edges are created based on the number of shared words between sentences. Differently from previous studies in multi-document summarization, we make a distinction between edges linking sentences from different documents (inter-layer) and those connecting sentences from the same document (intra-layer). As a proof of principle, our results reveal that such a discrimination between intra- and inter-layer in a multilayered representation is able to improve the quality of the generated summaries. This piece of information could be used to improve current statistical methods and related textual models.},

abstract = {Understanding the complexity of human language requires an appropriate analysis of the statistical distribution of words in texts. We consider the information retrieval problem of detecting and ranking the relevant words of a text by means of statistical information referring to the spatial use of the words. Shannon's entropy of information is used as a tool for automatic keyword extraction. By using The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin as a representative text sample, we show the performance of our detector and compare it with another proposals in the literature. The random shuffled text receives special attention as a tool for calibrating the ranking indices. {\textcopyright} 2008 EDP Sciences/Societ{\`{a}} Italiana di Fisica/Springer-Verlag.},
