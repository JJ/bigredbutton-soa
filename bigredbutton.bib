abstract="Network models have been increasingly used in the past years to support summarization and analysis of narratives, such as famous TV series, books and news. Inspired by social network analysis, most of these models focus on the characters at play. The network model well captures all characters interactions, giving a broad picture of the narration's content. A few works went beyond by introducing additional semantic elements, always captured in a single layer network. In contrast, we introduce in this work a multilayer network model to capture more elements of the narration of a movie from its script: people, locations, and other semantic elements. This model enables new measures and insights on movies. We demonstrate this model on two very popular movies.",
